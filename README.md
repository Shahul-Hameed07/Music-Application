Music Application Using Adobe XD
Basic music application with 10 songs using Adobe XD! This intense design sprint pushed me to think creatively, work efficiently, and deliver a high-quality user experience.

From wireframing to prototyping, I designed an intuitive and visually stunning music app that allows users to:

👉  play , pause , forward , Backward buttons for Songs

👉  By Touching the Thumbnail of the song it will navigate with different background and each are connected properly

👉  By Tap the pause button, it says “You Pause the Song”.

Note : "Currently , it will be created in the i-phone 11 Layout".
For Viewing the Project to follow the Steps :
1. Download Adobe XD 
2. In my Github Repository , Download the "Music Application.xd" and Open it on Adobe XD.

Take a look at my design process and prototype :
